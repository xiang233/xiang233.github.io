          <p>Is there really any distinction between the urgent and not urgent, the important and not important? Most would probably believe so. The belief has such a presence that, even with an eye closed, you could still sense if from the air. Or at least I could. </p>
<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gjpw02p83fj30sk0qqdil.jpg" style="zoom:30%">

<p>[^the famous Eisenhower Matrix]: I constantly land and dwell on the fourth quadrant …Sorry.</p>
<p>That if you are having a single trait or bearing a slight resemblance to the widely recognised image of a model student, you are expected to strive and behave like one, as if it is some crowning accolade. You are asked to focus on exams, on family, on sports, to stand upright and smile politely like Annie Hathaway and seek all the highest achievement like Ivanka Trump. Meticulously maintaining this facade, relishing the moment when everyone’s envious gazes attempt to pull it to crumble and break apart, while you are remaining perfectly still. </p>
<p>When I was a kid, I often asked my mom whether I could become a hairdresser, a philosopher, an economist, anything. She always replied, “of course you can,” but strangely followed by, “I believe you would be successful in any field you choose to engage in.” Yet what if I fail to, or don’t desperately want to, succeed? What if I would devote my whole life to a theory that gains no worthwhile result, or what if I’d rather wander aimlessly among a multitude of knowledge, where the possibility of discovery comes solely by chance?</p>
<p>There thus exists such distinctions. And it sounds reasonable that Eisenhower would, apart from categorising them, also categorise me as an incorrigible procrastinator. As I often resort to art, music and trivial writings, where the need to prioritise is absent. </p>
<p>Sometimes when deeply engrossed, I feel the urge to leave everything behind, plunge fully into the moment and not retract, or to shift completely to a new approach or perspective  towards a situation. So, I thought, what about re-defining these distinctions and prioritising scheme, by myself, for my own life? But there is certainly expense coming with changes - as Sabina Spielrein said, changes are inevitably associated with destruction of the former state. When the results of a newly established habit are no longer predictable, I hesitate to take the risk. Yes…I procrastinate during ‘urgent and important’ work, and I procrastinate even during procrastination. </p>
<p>While, lifespan is long and not every day is an HSC or SAT preparation day. There is always time to experiment with novelty, so why not start changing now?</p>

          <p>I enjoyed the film <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> by Stanley Kubrick very much and there are two aspects of the film – sexuality and dream – that particularly interests me. I think they demonstrate how id underpins humans’ psyches and infiltrates every realm of human ego, e.g. the religious, domestic and professional realms. </p>
<p>The film can be very much seen as a representation of Freud’s <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em>. It seems that at night, both Alice and Bill adventure in their “dreams” where their respective id impulses are fulfilled. Throughout the film a blurred line is drawn between dream and reality since through the characters’ dream-work, the unconscious is brought to the reality in a more manifest manner than dreams. For example, Bill’s actions in his nightly escapades are rooted in the reality, living out his dream and degradation of his character simultaneously, against what Freud said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “Would it not be right to bear in mind Plato’s dictum that the virtuous man is content to dream what a wicked man really does?” (Freud 614)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actions and consciously expressed opinions are as a rule enough for practical purposes in judging men’s characters.” (Freud 615)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alice, on the other hand, struggles in the dream of the orgy and the navy officer. Alice once tells Bill a dream in which she cheated on him, having sex with many other men and ridiculing him. Although Bill doesn’t analyse the dream psychoanalytically, he apparently recognises its ability to reveal Alice’s unconscious wishes because it justifies his later retribution against it. Thus, I wonder why Alice is so honest in confessing her dream, as if she is not aware of the consequences it might have on their marriage. A shot then captures Bill consoling her saying, “It’s only a dream.” I perceive it as an apparent irony. It echoes and contrasts with what he says in the ending scene that “and no dream is ever just a dream.” I interpret it as that the couple eventually reconcile with their dream thoughts and thus the underlying presence of each other’s’ id. Although I keep a very impartial record of my dreams in my dream journal and I don’t fear knowing my inner thoughts from there, when I’m sharing any dream with my friends, I would still filter out the too telling part, almost like a secondary censorship. Dream-work censors my id first and presents it to me, then I censor it again and present it to others, both fearing devastating this vulnerable ego of mine. I wonder what a state of mind would be and what a world would be if one can freely talk about his/her dreams and innermost desire without fear. </p>
<p>Alice’s dream, as it sounds to Bill, can be seen as her assertion of masculinity. On the other hand, Bill is feminised, and he suffers from a loss of ego. The feminization is implied when Bill is bashed into by a gang of teenagers who call him a “faggot”, and when the hotel receptionist played by Alan Cumming flirted with him while discussing the bruise on Nick’s face. These homosexual allusions seem to embody an impending “castration” for Bill. It is interesting that he decides to retrieve his ego through sex as a means of masculinization. In this retrieval he exploits his socio-economic status, profession and wealth, to gain him admittance. However, as he dabbles in the lower strata of society where he is superior economically, he feels an incompetence sexually and lets Domino take the initiative. On the contrary, as he enters the higher strata, the mansion, he is rejected not due to sexuality but that his status is no longer sufficient. The ironic shift demonstrates a strong association of sex with power. And not only to Bill and but also many of us in this society, the mediating role of ego fails to navigate between id and social realities. </p>

          <p>It is my first time reading Freud’s justification for his theory with support of clinical observations and I think he made many compelling arguments. We see that his aetiology inference had to be based on the proved success of Breuer’s cathartic method: if the ‘talking out’ of a specific traumatic scene has resolved the hysterical symptoms, that scene is known to be the causation of the patient’s hysteria. He thus carefully aligned his analytic and hypothetical inferences to therapeutic results, and I think it’s crucial to his arguments. He first proposed the two conditions always fulfilled by a traumatic scene responsible for hysteria, namely its suitability and traumatic force. He proved their validity as a test for the causation by saying that if an identified scene does not satisfy one, or both, of these conditions, subsequent treatments also give no therapeutic success. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>​        …to findings which are insufficient as an explanation both in respect to their suitability as determinants and to their traumatic effectiveness, we also fail to secure any therapeutic gain. (Gay 99)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>​        …make our way from the hysterical symptom to the scene which is really operative traumatically and which is satisfactory in every respect, both therapeutically and analytically. (Gay 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After subjecting puberty scenes to its test and failed, he traced back in the associative events to their very root - sexual infantile experiences – and found them the universal causations of his cases. Unlink the earlier scenes, they matched the two conditions and were uniform in kind. </p>
<p>I find all the arguments convincing so far. However, it’s hard to agree upon the generalizations he further extended from a total of eighteen cases to all cases and thus the conclusion on the “aetiology of hysteria”. He addressed possible objections concerning the public’s perceived prevalence of sexual assaults towards children and that of hysteria. With published evidence by a paediatrician he argued that the number of sexual assaults towards children is underestimated. He then objected the contrary objection that there are more sexual assault victims than hysterics by stating a precondition of being unconscious to the experience memory. I saw these as attempts to establish sexual infantile experiences as the sufficient and necessary condition for all hysteria, but his justifications are weak and speculative in nature. So, the question troubling me the most is: what leads Freud to be so insistent on sex as the only cause of hysteria? The well-established discovery of the associative framework of the neurosis reveals to me the possibility of non-sexual trigger events, since whether it being the causation depends on its connectedness to the hysterical symptom, rather than its sexual or non-sexual nature. The uniformity of sexual content is suggested by the limited amount of empirical evidence, which with the increase in sample size, can easily be undermined with counterexamples. </p>
<p>Anna O’s case, which in Breuer’s account is absent of any sexual elements, immediately comes up as an inconsistency. I did some research and found that, in Freud’s own version of the case, he pointed out that Breuer omitted to record the patient’s sexual transference to the doctor. An example included is Anna O’s cramps and accompanying remarks: “Now Dr. B.’s child is coming!” (Forrester 328) It made me realise the potential bias and incompleteness of all academic work especially when the author can be implicated by contentious issues like sexuality, evident in both Jung’s and Breuer’s work. </p>
<p>There are several implicit assumptions Freud made about genders. For example, men’s preparedness for sex, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>in whom a shrinking from sexuality, […] that they are, as it were, people who are psychically inadequate to meeting the demands of sexuality. This view, of course, leaves hysteria in men out of account. (Gay 101)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… and men’s aggressive position in sex. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>…obsessions can be regularly shown by analysis to be disguised and transformed self-reproaches about acts of sexual aggression in childhood and are therefore more often met with in men than in women, and that men develop obsessions more often than hysteria. (Gay 110)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freud’s brief description of the obsessional neurosis also resembles his later theory of repressed libido, as discussed in A Difficulty in the Path of Psychoanalysis. In there, women were excluded when Freud talked about the three major blows to narcissism of men collectively. I then found out that he later identified the blow to women’s narcissism separately as castration, which he claims to result in penis envy (Flax). His excess association of women with their traditional or natural roles lets me reconsider the effect of stereotypes on the formation of theories. Since sexuality concerns not only physiological differences but also social construction of gender roles, their influence on judgements seems inevitable. I wonder whether Freud’s theories on sexuality are still of value, or largely irrelevant, in this day and age as female sexuality have evolved to a great extent lately. </p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>“All men are created equal…” fifty-two mouths in a Fujian junior school classroom stumbled over Thomas Jefferson’s passage faithfully. Yue was not reciting. She tucked a sweaty lock of hair behind her ear, lifted her chin towards the window and thought to herself: “If this place really exists, I have to get there one day.”</p>
<p>The latest, most viral social media trend was always the first to be reviewed at a typical Monday meeting. This time playing on the screen was an internet celebrity doing traditional crafts, with the grace of a fairy, in an unspoiled, idyllic rural setting of China. Frank, the manager, enthused over how a follow-up on the same topic would appeal to urban citizens longing for an escape, and decided to allocate this job to Yue. </p>
<p>“After all, nobody here knows more about China than you do,” he added. </p>
<p>Indeed, it was only Yue’s fourth year in America. So quickly had she acquired a bachelor’s degree, then a green card and following that a promising position in journalism at All Headline Press. Flawless accent, chestnut-brown hair curled at the ends, light smokey eyes with fuchsia lips: all professing herself an American. </p>
<p>“Listening? Yue?” </p>
<p>Yet her surname was invoked at every turn when mere cultural difference was warranted, sounding a subtle note to everyone about her “authentic” identity. </p>
<p>“…I know it’s a tight turnaround, but you wouldn’t wanna miss the chance to run a fair representation of your homeland under the next headline.” </p>
<p>Representation? Yue was never inspired to do so, nor this time. </p>
<p>The next Monday, Yue was among the familiar cluster of Fujian tulou, or earthen houses, where she used to live. The domed roofs arched. Sparrows chirped in the rafters. Motorcycle exhaust lingered alongside the stagnant odour of garbage rotting. Wheels revved and rumbled on the paving stones.</p>
<p>It seemed that the past four years had made little impression here, but a lot on Yue. Being a “coastal elite” out and out, Yue had learned to speak with both horror and sympathy of Chinese rural life, which, as far as she troubled to recall it, was plainly poverty and vulgarity unworthy of any better representation. Out there, one thought, toiled, married and died.</p>
<p>From afar, Yue could see Aunty Sun, the hunched figure standing on the doorsteps. Aunty led her inside and eagerly agreed to Yue’s request for filming her Ju Ci, ceramic repairs, or, as Yue would rather put on the coverage title, curium porcelain artistry. </p>
<p>They walked through the noonday blaze into Aunty’s crafting stall, where Yue set up the camcorder and for the first time settled down to watch Aunty working. </p>
<p>“She began punching holes along the fracture with a drill…” Yue’s voice-over went. Aunty quickly corrected her: a diamond drill. A Ju Ci artisan’s world was steeped in a vocabulary of its own. It was never a drill but a diamond drill, never a staple but a carved gold staple or a curium or a copper staple. </p>
<p>“Each tool has its name and uniqueness,” Aunty said, “and the wisdom is that, when you get these names right, you narrow the gap between you and them.” </p>
<p>The few words stayed and stirred in Yue’s mind: gap, me, my name.</p>
<p>Now the joining of two pieces. Every shuffling between the grains was tentative and restless, the unsettlingly high pitch sending shivers down Yue’s spine. They then fit together seamlessly in Aunty’s hands, with their distinct frequencies silenced into none. She picked a curium staple out from the casket. Her eyes – brown, deep brown – but keen and clear as the curium lustre. The staple’s tails were insinuated into the holes, hammered softly, and again, until eventually rooted. Being underneath, through and above all at once, its metallic nerves made a weak claim of ascendancy, being rather of union. Aunty dipped her hands into an unappealing shade of grey, the mixture of ceramic powder and egg white, drew out a handful and plastered over the just mended thin vein. Only through these steps can one revive a vessel. </p>
<p>“How much it’s broken, and how much it can hold, in here,” she pointed to Yue’s heart, “are questions that we need to constantly ask ourselves.” </p>
<p>Years later, Yue could still vividly recount how, after scrutinizing her work, Frank tried hard to, without sounding politically incorrect, hint at an unsuccessful representation “in a journalism sense”. Yue did not mind. At least she had found a representation of herself, and a staple, hers, glowing in its own unassuming light. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>My story The Staple aims to capture some of the bicultural identity conflicts experienced by migrants overseas. To do this effectively, I designed the protagonist, Yue, to represent a large group of Chinese with the “Immigrant American Dream” of successfully immigrating and assimilating into American society, as described in paragraph 4. Even outstanding ones like Yue still suffer being made assumptions, although mostly harmless; however, she feels uncomfortable because she strongly identifies herself as an American and would like others to regard her the same way. The characterization draws inspiration from my daily observations of people with multicultural backgrounds. </p>
<p>My choice of the motif of “representation” is influenced by Some New Perspectives, a poem that conveys the insufficiency of tags in representing a full and genuine character. Opening with the challenge to “make a fair representation” of Chinese rural areas, a conflict is created between the video’s portrayal and Yue’s perfect knowledge about their real squalor. It also concerns a search for representation of self, analogous to identity, for Yue. </p>
<p>The story ultimately ends with the protagonist’s failure in the task, a satire on the contemporary click-chasing media, but a serendipitous success in finding her own identity. The blend of fulfilment and unfulfillment at the end resembles that of My Hakka Grandmother, where the poet’s loving recollection subtly accompanies a sense of not belonging. The title is echoed to reflect the restorative power of cultural practice for the mind.</p>
<p>The stylistic and symbolic elements in Translucent Jade also guide my writing, such as its rich employment of auditory imagery evoked by words “silence”, “music”, ‘sang”. In mine there are “frequencies”, “high-pitch” and “subtle note” to invigorate the emotional intensity porcelain expresses. The restoration process symbolises combining Yue’s dual identities, and the capacity of porcelain to contain things symbolises that of one’s mind to accommodate divisions and differences. </p>

          <p>My father once gave me the entire universe. </p>
<p>I used it for a while until a FengShui master was visited, </p>
<p>With a stroke of the brush he clemently dissolved</p>
<p>The vastness and voidness, </p>
<p>Through clouds and ice, snows and sleet, </p>
<p>To the mildly drizzling rain, </p>
<p>And I wonder if after it the sun will shine again. </p>
<p>Today I return to that point, before and after. </p>
<p>Barely, rarely recalled, it seemed mostly forgotten. </p>
<p>Obscured. I pondered it over. </p>
<p>It didn’t turn out as I expected I would be,</p>
<p>shedding tears like the early morning dews, </p>
<p>but there were love out in torrents, permeating every soil of my soul.</p>
<p>Sometimes I felt pusillanimous.</p>
<p>Sometimes I felt magnanimous.</p>
<p>What resonance is there?</p>
<p>Does this begin to infuse into me, </p>
<p>Do I to this belong?</p>
<p>This melodious, early morning solace, </p>
<p>The Rain. </p>
<hr>
<p> I was born and blessed with all of its gifts. </p>
<p>“Yao bequeathed Shun the world along with the jade”</p>
<p>The ether was touching its curve with a new charm,</p>
<p>And banishing for ever the traces of darkness. </p>
<p>“The flute when blown, mountains undulate.”</p>
<p>A low song of longing had been set singing</p>
<p>by the finery and beauty yet to be seen. </p>
<p>They, twinkling and tangling, but one, </p>
<p>Barely, rarely thought of, flashes in its modesty. </p>
<p>Ablaze. I let it in. </p>
<p>It was a little possessive, </p>
<p>As if asking for a private space but without my presence.</p>
<p>One for my father; the other for my mother. </p>
<p>One last to be mine, a gush of inward light that still shines. </p>
<p>What pulses are these?</p>
<p>Do they come to one in me, </p>
<p>Do I to it bind truly? </p>
<p>This abiding, ever-glowing possession, </p>
<p>My name. </p>
<p><em>The teacher asked us to each write a poem about our names, where they come from and what they mean to us. I wrote the first one for a friend and the second one for myself.</em> </p>
